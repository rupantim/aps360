Our model will predict the missing features \n","based on the information that we do have about each person.\n","\n","We will use a variation of a denoising autoencoder to solve this data imputation\n","problem. Our autoencoder will be trained using inputs that have one categorical feature artificially\n","removed, and the goal of the autoencoder is to correctly reconstruct all features,\n","including the one removed from the input.\n","\n","In the process, you are expected to learn to:\n","\n","1.

As a result, the model is weaker at predicting the value of the missing feature. For the next set of hyperparameters, I decided to target the spikes in the training accuracy and increased the batch size to ensure that they were not a result of optimizing a different loss function each time (consequence of a too-small batch size).\n","\n","<br>*Model #3:*\n","*  batch size = 256\n","*  optimizer: SGD with momentum = 0.9\n","\n","Increasing the batch size to 256 increased the validation accuracy to 65.09%. However, the validation loss was much higher compared to the previous models indicating the model was less certain of its predictions. Since the spikes in training accuracy remained, I tried swapping out the Adam optimizer with SGD, which does not perform adaptive learning. However, this did not result in more consistent performance. On the contrary, the model accuracies decreased while losses increased indicating lower model performance. Since the model was still overfitting to the training data after a certain number of iterations, I decided to revert back to the first set of hyperparameters (model #1) and decreased the number of training epochs to target overfitting.\n","\n","<br>*Model 4:*\n","*  number of epochs = 15\n","\n","Decreasing the number of training iterations effectively stopped the model from overtraining. There was almost no sign of overfitting to the training set, and the final validation accuracy increased to 67.26%.
